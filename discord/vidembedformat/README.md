# Discord Video Formation

- This is a website based tool using html, js and css
- I made this myself so i hope it is enjoyed

# Features
- Utilises the [Discord NFP](https://discord.nfp.is/) system to embed videos into [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- This uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API system to generate images (**optional**)

# Guidelines
- The images and videos must end in a file type. Only [.MP4](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-mp4/)
- The Video must be a x264 encoded video aswell otherwise you will most likely get no video and only sound
- This isn't an embedded **message system**, its an embedded **Video** system
